# Access Control: role and permission mapping.

This document outlines which roles have access to which permissions in the system.

## Role Bit Values

| Role        | Bit Value (Decimal) | Bit Value (Binary) |
|-------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| ðŸ‘¤ User      | 1                   | 0001               |
| ðŸ‘¥ Admin     | 2                   | 0010               |
| ðŸ’» Developer | 4                   | 0100               |
| ðŸ›¡ Owner     | 8                   | 1000               |

*Roles can be combined by bitwise OR operations. For example, a user with roles User and Admin would have a role bitmask of `3` (1 + 2).*

---

### ðŸ›¡ Owner
- access to all permissions:
- `can_take_admin`
- `can_give_admin`
- `can_assign_role`
- _and all developer and admin permissions_

## Notes

- Permissions follow the pattern `can_<action>_<target>`.
- The `name` field in `permissions` table is validated with regex: `^[a-z_]+$` (case-insensitive).

## User-Specific Permissions Bitmask

In addition to role-based permissions individual users can have **special permissions** assigned directly to them using a `permissions` bitmask field on the user record.

- The `permissions` integer stores additional permission bits granted specifically to the user.
- When checking permissions for a user **both the permissions granted by their roles and the user specific permissions are combined** using bitwise.
